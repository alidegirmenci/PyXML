Logistic Regression
===================

Detailed information about hyperparameter determination for the logistic 
regression method can be found on the Scikit-learn page. Scikit-learn's page 
for the linear regression method can be found at this `Link <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html>`_.
When the "Logistic Regression" radio button is clicked, the window for the 
logistic regression method becomes active and allows the hyperparameters of 
the method to be adjusted. Figure 31 shows the hyperparameter setting screen 
that is active upon selection of the logistic regression method.
