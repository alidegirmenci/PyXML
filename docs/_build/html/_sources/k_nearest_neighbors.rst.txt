k Nearest Neighbors
===================

Detailed information about hyperparameter determination for the k nearest 
neighbors method can be found on the Scikit-learn page. Scikit-learn's page 
for the k nearest neighbors method can be found at this `Link <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html>`_.
When the "k Nearest Neighbors" radio button is clicked, the window for the 
When the "k Nearest Neighbors" radio button is clicked, the window for the 
k nearest neighbors method becomes active and allows the hyperparameters 
of the method to be adjusted. Figure 34 shows the hyperparameter setting 
screen that is active upon selection of the k nearest neighbors method.
