Stochastic Gradient Descent
===========================

Detailed information about hyperparameter determination for the stochastic 
gradient descent method can be found on the Scikit-learn page. Scikit-learn's 
page for the stochastic gradient descent method can be found at this `Link <https://scikit-learn.org/0.15/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier>`_.
When the "Stochastic Gradient Descent" radio button is clicked, the window 
for the stochastic gradient descent method becomes active and allows the 
hyperparameters of the method to be adjusted. Figure 32 shows the hyperparameter 
setting screen that is active upon selection of the stochastic gradient descent 
method.
