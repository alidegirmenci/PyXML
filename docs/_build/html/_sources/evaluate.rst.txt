Evaluate
========

The "Evaluate" tab consists of two figure windows and seven entry widgets to 
display the performance of the created machine learning model on test data. 
The figure window at the top left visualizes the confusion matrix result of 
the performance of the machine learning model. Additionally, both the 
percentage and number of samples in True Negatives, False Positives, 
False Negatives, and True Positives can be viewed. The Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curve of the model can be seen at the bottom of the 
window. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, 
F1-score, G-mean, and ROC Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) can be learned from 
the top right side of the window. The performance result of the machine learning 
model is presented in Figure 41.
