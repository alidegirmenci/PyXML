Decision Tree
=============

Detailed information about hyperparameter determination for the decision 
tree method can be found on the Scikit-learn page. Scikit-learn's page for 
the decision tree method can be found at this `Link <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html>`_. 
When the "Decision Tree" radio button is clicked, the window for the decision 
tree method becomes active and allows the hyperparameters of the method to be 
adjusted. Figure 35 shows the hyperparameter setting screen that is active upon 
selection of the decision tree method.
