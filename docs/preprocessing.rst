Preprocessing 
=============

In this tab, pre-processing of the uploaded data is carried out for the 
application of machine learning algorithms. It enables users to check if 
there is missing data in the dataset. If there is missing data, data 
imputation methods can be applied to fill the missing data. The dataset is 
divided into training and test sets. Data scaling methods can be applied to 
scale the dataset. In addition, the result changes made to the data can be 
tabulated. The default version of the Preprocessing tab is shown in Figure 4.
