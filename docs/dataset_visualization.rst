Dataset Visualization
=====================

Box and whisker plots of features are drawn to visualize the dataset. It is 
a graphical representation that visually display the distribution of data 
into quartiles. A five-number summary of the data can be learned from 
box-and-whisker plots, which are the minimum, first quartile (Q1), 
median (second quartile or Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. 
Observations about the distribution of the data set displayed with a Box 
Plot

* Central Tendency:  median line (data tends to cluster around) 
* spread: length of the box and the extent of the whiskers
* Skewness: symmetry (evenly distributed) and asymmetry (skewed towards one end) 
* outliers: points outside the whiskers in the data and their values

A sample box-and-whisker plot and the descriptions of the quartiles are 
shown in Figure 24.

When clicked the “Dataset Visualization” button, box-and-whisker plot of the 
loaded dataset is drawn, as can be seen in Figure 25. In real-world datasets, 
some features in the loaded dataset may be very large values and some very 
small values, in which case it may not be possible to examine all features in 
the same graph. Therefore, the y-axis is in log scale.
